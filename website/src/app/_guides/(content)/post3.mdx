**Update: [As of Coolify v4.0.0-beta.361, Lite Queen is included in Coolify and can be installed in one click.](/guides/how-to-use-lite-queen-on-your-server-with-coolify--one-click-install/)**


In this guide we're going to manage SQLite databases on our VPS by hosting Lite Queen with [Coolify](https://coolify.io/). What is Coolify you ask?

> Coolify is an all-in one PaaS that helps you to self-host your own applications, databases or services (like Wordpress, Plausible Analytics, Ghost) without managing your servers, also known as an open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.



1. First off, we need to deal with [installing and setting up our Coolify instance in our VPS](https://coolify.io/docs/introduction).

2. Let's create a new **Project** and a Docker Compose **Resource** inside.

3. Let's add our Docker Compose configuration for the **Resource:**
    ```yaml
    services:
      lite-queen:
        image: 'kivsegrob/lite-queen:latest'
        volumes:
          - '/home/testuser/www:/www'
          - '/home/testuser/litequeen-data:/home/litequeen/data'
        labels:
          - caddy_0.basicauth.0_testuser=$2a$14$XXoxLTSzzVgMFzn.xTVMQeJzMPpnmPNvRYic4dGMeUmwiNL1y9nHq
    ```

    Let's go over the configuration:
    - `/home/testuser/www:/www`:  location of the sqlite databases in our server. Inside the Lite Queen container these will be accesible in `/www`(you can change this to another path if you wish).
    - `/home/testuser/litequeen-data:/home/litequeen/data`: This is needed to persist the data of Lite Queen. By default the data is stored inside `/home/litequeen/data`.
    - `caddy_0.basicauth.0_testuser=$2a$14$XXoxLTSzzVgMFzn.xTVMQeJzMPpnmPNvRYic4dGMeUmwiNL1y9nHq`: Here, we're adding basic auth with Caddy to protect the our Lite Queen instance. In Coolify, we configure Caddy using the [caddy docker proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) inside labels.

4. Let's add a domain and connect it to our Lite Queen container

    - You can set the domain by going to the `Settings` in the service: 
    
      <Image src="https://media-files-go-brrr-project.kiv-d-dev.workers.dev/i/nhlp8w18l262nj4o78n2v8iywsbc"/>

    - Let's map our domain to the port 8000 in the Lite Queen container(port used by default). This is done by putting the domain, followed by a semicolon and then the port 8000.
    
      <Image src="https://media-files-go-brrr-project.kiv-d-dev.workers.dev/i/5x3sz2lntqz18qfyswgtojlfdl1k"/>
     




5. After saving and reloading the configuration(*Pull Latest Images & Restart* button), you should be able to see the initial screen of Lite Queen. Happy Hosting!
