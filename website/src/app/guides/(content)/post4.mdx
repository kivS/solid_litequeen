As of [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) `v4.0.0-beta.361`, Lite Queen is included as a service and be installed with one click.

We can start by creating a new Resource and search for Litequeen:

    <Image src="https://media-files-go-brrr-project.kiv-d-dev.workers.dev/i/2sfdik2msk4rndxohk9zlfagfaf6"/>

After that, we need to press on `Edit Docker Compose` and let Lite Queen know where your SQLite projects are located in your server filesystem

For example, in my server I keep my project's files in `/home/hellouser/www` so let's map that into `/www` inside the Coolify container:

```yaml
 -
    type: bind
    source: /home/hellouser/www
    target: /www
    is_directory: true
```

This way if I have a SQLite database in `/home/hellouser/www/project1/storage/production.sqlite3`, in the Lite Queen application we can add the database by using `/www/project1/storage/production.sqlite3`.

That's all you need, go ahead and deploy Lite Queen!
